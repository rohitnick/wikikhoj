<h3>Ever stood out of your class for putting too many queries? <br/>
Ever felt that search engines produce a vast insensible grid of links?<br/>
if(yes) : print('oh boy!! suddenly, you are at the right place!');</h3>
<h4><strong>People of the world, Welcome To WikiKhoj.</strong> <br/><br/>

We work with a VISION: There are no dumb questions. Only dumb links. We eliminate those links for you. And deliver to you ONLY what is asked - spam free, uncluttered, and recommended. We provide info that lies somewhere in that network of hyperlinks, but takes a HELL LOT OF DIGGING. We infest your mind with all the answers it needs until it runs out of them. And, know what, we *BOAST* of it!
